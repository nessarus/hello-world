Hello world!

Looks like I have finally made it on to github. It's been a long time coming but I'll finally become a programmer. I will be adding more to this space as I slowly built up my code base and will be sharing anything I think others will find useful. Well, hope you stick around and see this space grow. 

Regards, 
nessarus.
